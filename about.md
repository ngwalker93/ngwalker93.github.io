# About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m Nancy ðŸ‘‹

I live in Californiaâ€™s Inland Empire and am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Applied Data Science at the University of San Diego ðŸ”¢ðŸ“Š. Beyond my studies, Iâ€™m also a proud mom of energetic twin toddler boys.

My academic background is in Biology and Public Health â€” I earned my B.S. in Biology from the University of California, Merced, and my Master of Public Health from West Coast University.

My professional background is in laboratory work and education. I spent two years as a substitute teacher across various subjects, one year as a laboratory assistant performing phlebotomy, and five years as a research scientist in a research and development laboratory.

Iâ€™m passionate about scientific exploration ðŸ”¬ðŸ§«ðŸŒ±, I enjoy working in the lab, studying cells through assays and flow cytometry, and now I bring that same curiosity into data science, where I love analyzing datasets and uncovering meaningful insights.

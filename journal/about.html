                <p>I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Applied Data Science at the University of San Diego. Beyond my studies, I'm also a proud mom of energetic twin toddler boys.</p>
                <p>My academic background is in Biology and Public Health â€” I earned my B.S. in Biology from the University of California, Merced, and my Master of Public Health from West Coast University.</p>
                <p>My professional background is in laboratory work and education. I spent two years as a substitute teacher across various subjects, one year as a laboratory assistant performing phlebotomy, and five years as a research scientist in a research and development laboratory.</p>
                <p>I'm passionate about scientific exploration ðŸ”¬ðŸ§«ðŸŒ±, I enjoy working in the lab, studying cells through assays and flow cytometry, and now I bring that same curiosity into data science, where I love analyzing datasets and uncovering meaningful insights.</p>
